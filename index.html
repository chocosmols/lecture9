            <p><strong>Cake:</strong> For the cake base, I chose to use the best chocolate cake recipe. This has been my go-to chocolate cake for years and it never fails me!</p> 
            <p><strong>Filling:</strong> I contemplated a few different filling options for this cake, but ultimately decided on using sliced strawberries. You could also finely dice the strawberries if you prefer.</p>

                <p><strong>Frosting:</strong> For the frosting, I decided to use my strawberry frosting recipe. It's made with fresh strawberries and is a riff on my buttercream frosting, so you know it's going to be nice and fluffy and delicious.</p> 
                <p> <strong>Decoration:</strong> If we're going to make a chocolate strawberry cake, we may as well make it really beautiful, right? I finished mine with chocolate ganache and fresh strawberries. They both make the cake more beautiful and more delicious.</p>

                <p>Obviously the best place to start with making this cake is with the cake layers themselves.</p>

                <p>The cake batter is super easy to make: simply whisk together the dry ingredients, then add the wet ingredients and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes. The batter will be thin, so don't be concerned about that!</p>
                    
                <p>Pour the batter into two greased and floured 9-inch cake pans and bake for about 30-35 minutes.</p>

            <p>Let the cakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack and cool them completely before assembling.</p>
            <p>When you're ready to assemble. Place one of the cake layers on a cake plate or cardboard cake round. Top it with about â…“ of the strawberry frosting.</p>
            <p>Place the sliced strawberries on top of the frosting to evenly cover the top of the cake layer.</p>
            <p>Place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and outside of the cake with the remaining frosting.</p>

                <p>Top with the ganache, letting it drip down the sides of the cake if desired. Decorate with additional strawberries; you can even dip some whole strawberries into the ganache for an extra-special touch.</p>
                <p>Store the cake in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Let the cake come to room temperature before enjoying.</p>

                <p>Because of the ganache and the fruit in the frosting, I recommend storing this chocolate strawberry cake in the refrigerator. </p>
                <p>You could make and assemble the cake up to a day ahead of time, but I would wait to decorate with the fresh strawberries until the day you plan to serve it.</p>
                <p>If you want, you can make all of the components of the cake in advance and wait to assemble the cake.</p>

<p>I took inspiration from Allan J. Huang's example website. Allan used one 12 grid for the banner, and then 12, 3 grids for the rest. It's very simple, that's why I liked it.</p>
